         I know everything needed to make a website function,
         efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond

          They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself
          as a remote web developer. I made their
          website and showed it to them. They liked it.
          And uploaded the content. It was fun working at
          Programming Hero.</h3>
